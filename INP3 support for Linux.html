<title>INP3 support for Linux</title>
</head><body bgcolor="white"><h1>InterNode Protocol support for Linux</h1>


	<p>
	</p><h2>Why bother?</h2>
	There are several reasons why I wrote this and why you should consider using it:
	<ul>
	<li><b>Avoid multiple AX.25 stacks</b><br>
		When using XNET or TheNetNode ontop of linux you basicly have
		two AX.25 stacks, although you need only one.
	</li><li><b>Modular approach</b><br>
		Most node programs try to be a solution to all problems,
		offering a dozen different services in one monolithic
		program.
		With the Linux kernel stack you will have the option to run
		each server (node, bbs, convers) seperatly.
		This gives you more options and more reliability since one
		service may be brought down without harming the others.
	</li><li><b>Better route propagation</b><br>
		This implementation tries to prevent huge amounts of data being
		propagated. (This is explained later)
	</li><li><b>Its Free Software</b><br>
		This is most obvious when compared with XNET in which case you
		have to rely completly on a single source for bugfixes or
		changes. When using Free Software you atleast have the option
		of doing it yourself.
		Although TheNetNode comes with source it still has a very
		restrictive license that is absolutly NOT compatible with
		the definitions of an Open Source license.
	</li></ul>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	</p><h2>Status</h2>
	The patch is currently succesfully used on several systems.
	Keep in mind however that this is a work in progress.<br>
	Versions 001 and 002 had some problems with propagating negative
	routes, this should be fixed in version 003.
	Since version 003 multiple local interfaces are supported and it
	is possible to set their mnemonics right.
	Version 004 has a fix for a rtt/rif race and can send out multiple
	negative routes in one RIF. 
	<p></p>
	<p>
	</p><h2>Todo</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Add negative preload.
		</li><li>test, test, test, test it again....
	</li></ul>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	</p><h2>Getting started</h2>
	<ul>
	<li><b><i>Download the patch: <a href="http://sharon.pi8zaa.ampr.org/users/pe1rxq/2.6.4-inp.diff">2.6.4-inp.diff</a></i></b>
	<br>
	</li><li>Patch your kernel
	</li><li>Compile and install the netrom module
	</li><li>Load the ax25 and netrom modules as you normally would
	</li><li>Attach the netrom interface (If you use the patched version of
	nrattach, found <a href="http://sharon.pi8zaa.ampr.org/users/pe1rxq/index.html">here</a> multiple interfaces
	are supported and their mnemonic is automaticly set)
	</li><li>Start netromd or add your neighbours manually

	</p><h2>INP specification</h2>
	The following sections will go into the specification of the protocol
	which unfortunatly isn't as clear as it should be.
	It can be found at: <a href="http://www.nordlink.org/html/inp3.htm">

	<b>Integration with the existing NET/ROM stack</b>
	</p><ul>
		<b><i>Translating time to quality</i></b><br>
		In order to make routing decisions that make sense a node needs to
		know how to to translate a time measurment to a quality.
		If this is not done there is no way to compare a route via an INP
		neighbour to a route via a normal NET/ROM node.
		In the specification this is not addressed.
		This will inevitably leed to different algorithms being implemented
		which might lead to network unreliability.<br>
		TheNetNode uses the folowing algorithm
		<ul><br><i>
			qual = 255 - ( rtt / 10 )
		</i></ul><i><br></i>
		Where qual is limited between 3 and 254 and rtt is in 10ms
		In this case the maximum time for a node before it dissapears is about
		25 seconds.
		<br><br>
		The algorithm used by XNET is not known (closed source remember...)
		but judging by the qualities displayed it is close to the following:
		<ul><br><i>
			qual = 255 - ( rtt / 30 )
		</i></ul><i><br></i>
		Although the quality used in the netrom broadcasts differs from this...
		This leads to a maximum time of about 75 seconds which seems to be
		large.
		For the Linux implementation I have choosen to use a division factor of 20.
		This leads to a horizon at about 50 seconds.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b><i>Propagation of non INP capable nodes</i></b>
		In the specification there is no mention about the propagation of
		non-INP nodes accross the network.
		However watching the current implementations it seems that existing
		nodes have their quality translated to a target time and propagated
		as regular INP nodes from the first INP capable node on.
		For this to be possible there needs to be some magic to translate the
		node's quality into a target time and a hop count.
		TheNetNode seems to be simply using the reverse of the method described
		above.
		For the Linux implementation I use the same method.
	</ul>
	
	
	<p>
	<b>L3RTT FRAME</b><br>
	</p><ul>
		In the 'official' INP3 specification there are a few things missing in
		the L3RTT frame format, the frametype (INFOFRAME) and for the last
		few decades a Carriage Return has always been 0x0d and not 0x10.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b><i>L3RTT frame format</i></b>
	<table border="1">
		<tbody><tr>
		<td>7</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>n</td><td>1
		</td></tr>
		<tr>
			<td>AX.25 shifted
			</td><td>AX.25 shifted
			</td><td>0x02
			</td><td>0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
			</td><td>0x05
			</td><td>TEXT
			</td><td>0x0d
		</td></tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Source node call
			</td><td>L3RTT-0
			</td><td>TTL
			</td><td>Dummy header
			</td><td>Frametype
			</td><td>ASCII
			</td><td>CR
		</td></tr>
	</tbody></table>
	<br>
	<b><i>TEXT field: (There is a space between each field)</i></b>
	<table border="1">
		<tbody><tr>
			<td>6
			</td><td>10
			</td><td>10
			</td><td>10
			</td><td>10
			</td><td>6
			</td><td>11
			</td><td>n
			</td><td>n
			</td><td>n
		</td></tr>
		<tr>
			<td>L3RTT:
			</td><td>n
			</td><td>n
			</td><td>n
			</td><td>n
			</td><td>XXXXXX
			</td><td>LEVEL3_V2.1
			</td><td>LINUX001
			</td><td>$M60000
			</td><td>$N
		</td></tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Frame identifier
			</td><td>TX time (in 10ms)
			</td><td>Smoothed rtt
			</td><td>Last rtt
			</td><td>pointer to node
			</td><td>Mnemonic
			</td><td>version
			</td><td>software version
			</td><td>max time
			</td><td>inp3 identifier
		</td></tr>
	</tbody></table>
	<br>
		According to the spec the text field should contain
		'implementation specific information' and it should be scanned
		for flags only (such as the $N flag for marking a node inp
		capable).
		However XNET does not seem to accept a neighbour that is not
		transmitting the rtt and smoothed rtt fields in this fasion.
		Also it will always take the netrom mnemonic specified in this
		field no matter how often you tell it otherwise using normal
		broadcasts.
		In order to be compatible the Linux implementation will follow
		this format with some changes (the time and pointer field are
		used to store the two fields of a struct timeval).
	<p></p>
	</ul>


	<p>
	<b>Route Propagation</b><br>
	</p><ul>
		In the specification there is a discinction between positive
		and negative information.
		Positive information should only be transmitted if there is a
		minimum percentual and a minimum absolute decrease of the target
		time.
		For linux these are 25% and 100ms respectivly.
		To prevent Broadcast storms all positive propagation is delayed
		and done only once every five minutes.<br>
		<br>
		However for negative information there is only one rule defined:
		Propagate it immediatly. With the addition that there may be an
		extra negative preload added.
		At the moment all negative data is propagated without any preload.
		Adaptive preload calculation is planned for later, at the moment
		I am focussing on getting the implementation to work properly.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Additions to the specification:</i><br>
		<br>
		According to the specification routes are only transmitted on link
		connect or on change. However if a node for some reason drops a route,
		this might be due to a bug, it will get lost forever.
		As another example, it is possible in Linux to remove the netrom module
		while the ax25 module will keep the interlink intact....
		To prevent this every few hours all routes are resend to the neighbours.
		Since the state we try to prevent is (hopefully) rare there is no need
		to do this often.
		<br>
		Furthermore provisions have been taken to ensure that also
		cummulative changes are propagated.
		For example:
		If a route is propagated with a target time of 1000ms and
		each time a rtt frame is measured it decreases with 10ms.
		On themself these decreases do not justify the route to be
		propagated again.
		But when this continous over time the target time will
		become lower than the threshold and it eventually will get
		propagated.
	</ul>
