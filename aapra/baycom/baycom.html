<H3>USCC&gt;4 card</H3>
</center>
The BayCom USCC&gt;4 is a universal 16 bit slotcard for IBM's standard ISA bus.
The basic card integrates the digital part and four generic modem slots. In each of them, a piggy-back modem can be inserted. There are different modems for all baud rates used in today's packet radio operation. All modems can be combined randomly. Thus, the USCC&gt;4 is the basis for a universal packet radio station, growing with the user's requirements. In the following, the basis card and the modems available are described in detail. We only added some schematics to keep this file small. For more information on the card jump to the BayCom Web site.
