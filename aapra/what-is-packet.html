<H3>What is Packet Radio?</H3>
</center>
PACKET RADIO is a means by which error-free information can be 
transmitted and received.  It requires a computer for its 
operation, and normally the operators communicate by means of 
keyboards and monitor screens.  Facilities to store and forward 
messages are usually available, as is access to bulletin boards 
and databases.  The mode of Packet is an ideal marriage for the 
radio amateur who dabbles with computers and is an interesting way 
to obtain ERROR FREE communication in either rag chewing, 
programme or information transfer and satellite communication.

<P>
If however, you are not computer minded but wish to be involved in 
Packet, there is really no problem as the role of the computer can 
be very elementary.

<H3>Packet in detail</H3>

Packet is a development of the original modes of radio 
communication such as Morse and Teletype.  These modes are 
essentially digital patterns of ON-OFF signals and are used to 
represent items of information such as letters of the alphabet, 
numbers, punctuation etc.  The signals are transmitted between 
stations by methods such as radio or cables, and are written down 
or printed out.
<P>
<B>Morse</B> is a relatively slow but simple mode.  The brain and ears 
form a sensing device that is superior to other means of receiving 
Morse code patterns, as they are much better at pattern 
recognition in the presence of extraneous signals 
and noise.
<P>
In order better to automate communication, teletype was developed.  
It involved more complex patterns generated by mechanical 
"computers".
<P>
This gave improved speed and good recognition of patterns.  But it 
is susceptible to production of false patterns when extraneous 
signals and noise are received.  Because of the speed involved, 
brain and ears no longer help, although there is still use for the 
brain in guessing what corrupted messages were meant to say.  The 
same problems occur even after electronic devices have supplanted 
the mechanical ones.
<P>
<B>RTTY</B> (Radio TeleTYpe) characters are made up of groups of five 
ON-OFF signals - the standard code now used was devised by a New 
Zealand sheep farmer named Murray, though generally it is misnamed 
Baudot code which is a less efficient earlier code.
<P>
With the same sort of electronic equipment, <B>ASCII</B> code which 
provides up to 255 characters using a seven or eight unit code, 
can be employed.  It is subject to the same kind of interference 
problems as Baudot when used in radio communications, so it is 
rarely used unadorned.  Within a computer there is no 
interference, so as you probably know, all computers talk ASCII of 
some sort.
<P>
To improve message transfer, error correction was incorporated, 
and <B>AMTOR</B> (Amateur Microprocessor Teleprinting Over Radio) is one 
such development.  It uses code in groups of three characters, so 
that the value of each group must total a fixed sum.  If it does 
not, when the receiver adds it up, it is rejected and 
retransmission is requested.  When it is correct it accepts it and 
asks for the next group.  Using this mode, almost error free 
messages can be exchanged.  When propagation conditions are bad, 
the rate of information transfer will slow down but it will still 
be error free.  However, the number of character types is limited 
by the five unit code, and there has to be a reactive link between 
both ends of the communication path.
<P>
Here is where <B>PACKET</B> comes in.
<P>
Packet uses ASCII code, so can have 255 symbols. Messages are sent 
in groups of up to 255 units as compared with the three of AMTOR.  
Complex error checking is installed, as is information to guide 
the Packets through the system.  The system is comprised of 
Terminal Node Controllers (<B>TNC</B>) connected to transceivers, each 
linked with its own computer that gives commands to the TNC and 
writes and displays the messages.  The packets are dispatched 
entirely automatically. They provide an error-free means of 
communication that permits multiple use of a single frequency.  
Anything that can be put into digital form can be sent over Packet 
radio; for example, digital sound or television.
<P>
At the present time it is very easily used to transmit written 
messages, computer programmes and files that are written in ASCII 
or even binary code, between radio amateurs.  And the result is a 
screen full of characters in front of your eyes.
<P>
Bulletin Board Systems (<B>BBS</B>) form a useful part of the system, 
providing the source of lots of information and can act as 
"mailboxes".  They also help in the spread of information by 
communicating with each other, exchanging files and messages.  
Most Packet is best used on VHF, and using the property of 
digipeating, VHF links over long distances form a useful 
communication network. HF radio is less efficient with Packet due 
to propagation difficulties often giving rise to many errors, 
hence retries, so that information  transfer is much slower.  
Packet lengths need to be reduced.  In these conditions AMTOR may 
be better, but the restricted number of characters used by AMTOR 
creates difficulties in linking Packet and AMTOR systems. A system 
to join the two, called <B>APLINK</B>, is now being used to connect 
Packet systems more effectively across long distances.
<P>
This very brief description leaves a lot unsaid, but it should 
lift some of the veil of mystery surrounding Packet. It is just 
the thing for people who are interested in both radio and 
computers, but it also is a fine means of communication for people 
who can remember about three simple keyboard commands.
