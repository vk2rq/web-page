AAPRA has introduced a new multi-speed modem to augment the existing
very popular <A HREF="blakpak.html">BlakPak</A> 1200 baud FSK modem.
The YAM "Yet Another Modem" was designed by Nico Palermo, IV3NWV originally
for use at 9600 baud. It wasn't long before it was realised that the design was
just as useful for 1200 baud FSK, not to mention 2400 baud FSK.
Perhaps 4800 baud is next...
<P>
<I>How is this possible?</I><BR>
The modem uses hardware that is reconfigurable to allow the different speeds to
be chosen. What's more, this is all done under software control - there are
no switches to flick or components to change. The secret is the programmable
gate array - that big square chip on the picture below. The chip contains a
huge number of gates that are hooked together when the chip is programmed.
The program defines what the chip does - whether it's a modem or a LED flasher
and what speed it operates at.
<P>
Nico, YAM's designer has put together an excellent web site which includes information on
how the chip is programmed with an amazing amount of detail. It also has the circuit diagram and
files for downloading including all the drivers and configuration files.
Check it out at:

The YAM modem is housed in a small black "remote control" case measuring 138mm by
70mm by 28mm. At one end is the DB25 socket for connection to the computer
COM port. On one side of the case there is a 5 pin DIN socket for connection
to the radio. There are also three LEDs to indicate the state of the modem.
There is no power supply input as the YAM is completely powered from the COM
port of the computer just like the BlakPak modem.

The AAPRA version of the YAM modem contains a number of modifications that
improve the original design. The main one is the inclusion of a watchdog
timer on the PTT signal allowing the modem to meet regulatory requirements
for use unattended in Australia. The PTT circuit has also been changed to
boost it's current sinking ability. Some changes have also been made to
reduce the current consumption. These improvements are exclusive to AAPRA.
<P>
The YAM modem is assembled and fully tested "on air" by AAPRA and is supplied,
together with WinPack software and drivers, an excellent manual which includes a full
circuit description and cable connections for several popular radios for just $120.
The modem is not available in kit form from AAPRA. We want to make it as easy
to get going with the YAM as possible.<P>
