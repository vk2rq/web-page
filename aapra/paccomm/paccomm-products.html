<H3>Picopacket</H3>
</center>
<P>
The Picopacket breaks new ground in terms of both size and performance.
Although actually slightly smaller than a packet of cigarettes
the Pico offers the same Packet performance as it's larger brothers
such as the Tiny 2 including support for GPS making it ideal for
mobile tracking applications where space is critical.

<P>
The Tiny 2 is often regarded as a World-wide standard for Packet
Radio operation. With over 14,000 in use the Tiny enjoys tremendous
hardware and software support.

We are presently supplying the MK 2 version which offers extra
features over and above the original design including support
for GPS (Global Positioning System) interfaces.
<P>
The Tiny is also used extensively in the ROSE network.

<P>
The PacComm Sprint-2 is a third generation High-Speed Packet Controller
capable of 9.6 - 64k operation by simply moving internal jumper
links making it the ideal choice for both terrestrial and Satellite
users. It's worth noting that this is one of the ever growing
range of products to use the tried and tested G3RUH design offering
superior performance over and above existing 9600 designs.

<U><B>G3RUH Technology verses other designs..</B></U>
<P>
Other manufacturers use either a single chip or 'simplified' G3RUH
design (usually unlicensed) to keep the component coasts down.
Whilst such approaches will perform fine on the bench and in a
5+9 link situation it just doesn't happen like that in the real
world and these cheaper imitations soon reveal their true worth.
