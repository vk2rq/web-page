<H2>How to get on Packet Radio</H2>
</center>
Although Packet radio involves high technology and the latest 
state of the art components, the basic equipment required is 
relatively simple to assemble (as many amateurs have found). You 
can of course obtain pre-assembled units at a most reasonable 
price.

<H3>The Computer</H3>

There are of course many breeds and varieties of computer.  
Essentially the only requirement is that the computer be able to run a 
communications program. There are many such programs. paKet, YAPP,
PKTWin and WINPACK can be found in public domain/shareware 
libraries and are also available from the AAPRA software library. The 
vital requirements are that its parameters can be set to:-
<P>
<PRE>
        baud rate       1200 or higher
        parity          even or nil
        data bits       7 or 8
        stop bits       1 or 2
</PRE>
It is via this program that data is sent between you and the 
TNC. The commands issued to the TNC are also via the same 
program.

<HR>
<H3>TNC and MODEM</H3>

<H5>Hardware Type</H5>
These two units are sometimes combined into a neat black box which 
contains its own microprocessor, usually a Z80. It will also 
include memory chips for holding its program and the data you 
will be transmitting and receiving.  Another chip, the HDLC 
integrated circuit, does all the checking and handling of the data 
as it enters and leaves the TNC.  The advantage of using a TNC is 
that your PMS (Personal Message System) is accessable even when 
your computer is turned off or being used for some other task.

<H5>Software Type</H5>
These modems are available in both kit and built up form and the 
only disadvantage is that if you want to run a PMS (Personal 
Message System) your machine has to be on all the time. The answer 
to this is use the many BBSs for leaving messages on as they do operate 
continuously.  

<HR>
<H3>Transceiver</H3>
The bulk of operation at this time is on VHF-FM.  The original 
channel set aside for the mode was 147.575 MHz and usage has now 
spread to other frequencies such as 147.600, 144.800, 144.850, 
144.900 & 145.050. This list is not exhaustive and specific operating
frequencies depend on the area in which you are located. Typical packet 
action is in the lower half of the two metre band (144.700 to 
145.175), so have a listen, or ask some local operators.
<P>
HF operation is increasing; this can be helpful to those living 
away from repeater-serviced areas.  The BBS service also makes 
good use of frequencies within these bands. 10.147 and 14.107MHz 
and surrounding frequencies are popular. Gateways to 40m are also in use.
<P>
UHF usage is less popular than VHF.  These frequencies are used to 
provide links between main centres for through traffic flow, 
rather than have this traffic clutter the local VHF 
frequencies.  This is most desirable in the higher density areas.
<P>
Ideally a transceiver for Packet should have such a frequency response as to 
keep the levels of the Packet tones equal. PacComm have a radio 
tailored to the needs of digital radio only. On many BBS systems 
you can find radio modification files, however for 1200 baud 
operation the connection of your radio to the TNC is simply made by
connecting to the MIC and Speaker socket and adjusting the levels to 
provide satisfactory performance.  Full instructions will be 
supplied with the device you choose.
