KA9Q: NOSview RELEASE [304]
===========================
by Ian Wade, G3NRW

NOSview, first introduced in September 1991, is an on-line
documentation and runtime package for the KA9Q Network
Operating System (NOS).  It contains:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

***  probably the only complete reference work anywhere
     that describes all of the commands to be found in the
     major NOS releases.

***  a TSR file viewer that lets you read the NOSview
     documentation on-line, without breaking out of NOS.

***  NOSgas: the "NOS Get-Away Special"  --  a complete set
     of working NOS runtime software, based on the PA0GRI
     2.0m release.

***  a complete set of templates for the NOS control files.

***  full details on how to get the book "NOSintro", which
     describes in detail how TCP/IP works and how to use
     KA9Q NOS.  Ideal for beginners to TCP/IP (and more
     advanced users will find many gems of helpful
     information there as well).

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


NOSview [304] contains many new documentation files, and
the template NOS control files match the listings in the
book "NOSintro".

    AX.25 Baycom Packet Driver
    KISS protocol documentation
    HOSTS <> DOMAIN conversion programs
    PCElm and ELM Mailers
    The Clockwork VIEW TSR file viewer
