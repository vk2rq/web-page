which are now surplus to AAPRA requirements, and these will
be sold at bargain prices.  Be sure to be early as these will be

<H4>BlakPak lives!</H4>
<B>23/5/2002:</B> A surge in interest in this top little modem has prompted the release of the final
batch of BlakPak units. The TCM3105 modem chip used in this design is no longer available so our stocks
will be strictly limited. If you want one, please let us know soon and they will be available shortly.
BlakPak is described as the "best available" packet modem in the article on packet radio
on page 50 of the May 2002 edition of <I>Amateur Radio</I> magazine.

<B>From Rob McKnight, VK2MT, 30th August 2001:</B>
We have been officially informed that there will be a maximum figure of $300.00
attached to each existing Amateur Club that has equipment at a <A HREF="http://www.transgrid.com.au" TARGET="">TransGrid</A> site.
(The figure may be less, but definitely no more.) There won't be a charge
per antenna as was going to be the case - all existing and documented (by
TransGrid) antennas will be part of the deal.<BR>
The only provisos being:<BR>
- An Amateur Club has to have Public Liability Insurance of $10,000,000.<BR>
- An Amateur Club has to have Volunteer Workers Insurance.<BR>
- A Deed of Licence will be sent to the Club & will need to be signed &
returned.<BR>
- This $300 maximum rate could apply only to EXISTING Amateur tenants.
(Still to be clarified.)<BR>
- TransGrid retains the right to ask an Amateur Club to move their antennas
or equipment if a new full-paying tenant requests access AND there is no space
left on the tower or the building. This is not that bad at most sites.<P>
Overall, these provisos are not too bad - a lot better than paying $3,000!.<BR>
<B>VK2IO:</B> This positive outcome directly affects the VK2RND node which we hope shall return
to service at its previous site on Mt Sugarloaf.

<B>June 2001:</B> Notification was received on the 5th of June that the VK2RND site on Mt Sugarloaf, west of Newcastle
will be subject to exorbitant annual site fees applicable from the 1st of July. These charges are being 
forcibly imposed by the <A HREF="http://www.accc.gov.au" TARGET="">ACCC</A> on all lessees of <A HREF="http://www.transgrid.com.au" TARGET="">TransGrid</A> sites.
Unless we exert pressure on the ACCC and politicians to have this decision reversed, there will be no option but to close down the site,
one of the most important in the network. This decision also affects voice repeaters and the communications
systems of volunteer services such as WICEN and VRA at other sites. Please act now and save VK2RND!

<B>June 2001:</B> <A HREF="digipeat.html"><I>DIGIPEAT</I></A> readers may be forgiven for experiencing a touch of déjà vu as they turn to page 66
of their June edition of <A HREF="http://www.radiomag.com">Radiomag</A>. Dust off your <A HREF="digipeat.html#Oct98">October-December 1998</A> newsletter
and open it at page 4. Hmmm - bears a remarkable resemblance, doesn't it? There's something missing from Radiomag though - an attribution
to the principal author Gerard, VK2IO. If you don't have the original, see it here: <A HREF="TeleText.html">TeleText - The Silent Revolution</A>
In any case, thanks for the publicity, Radiomag!

<H4>2001 AGM</H4>
</center>
<B>May 2001:</B> This year's AGM was held under blue skies on Sunday, 20th May despite the forecast of rain.
The election saw the year 2000 committee members returned with the addition of John Bishop, VK2ZOI who
some of you may know through the <A HREF="http://marconi.careless.net/hadarc/">Hornsby And Districts Amateur Radio Club (HADARC)</A>.
Welcome John!<BR> After the formalities were over, members enjoyed sumptuous steaks, sausages and salad organised by Jo, VK2KAA. Thanks Jo!
The <A HREF="committee.html">office bearers</A> were elected at the June committee meeting.

<B>February 2001:</B> Congratulations to Moss Webb, VK2DP, the winner of the <A HREF="http://www.ccarc.org.au/fieldday/index.html">Wyong Field Day</A>
guessing competition and recipient of the AAPRA <A HREF="yam.html">YAM 1200/2400/9600 bps modem</A>.
Moss is pictured accepting his prize from Gerard, VK2IO. Thanks to all who entered the competition and renewed their
membership on the day and those who dropped by for a chat. With most items selling out it was a highly successful day for AAPRA!

<H4>HF ROSE</H4>
</center>
<B>May 2001:</B> Access to the NSW ROSE network is now possible on HF. Barry, VK2AAB has set up an experimental port on 40m.
It's currently operating on 7.040 MHz at 300 bps under the callsign VK2AAB-4 and coverage reports
so far have been encouraging. The longer term plan is to upgrade the port to 1200 bps PSK and link to
other ROSE nodes around the country. If you've got access to HF packet, give it a go!
