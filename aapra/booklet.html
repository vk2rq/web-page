                   INTRODUCTION</B>

The intention of this booklet is to provide in 
plain language, a basic understanding of what 
Packet is about.  At first glance it may appear 
complicated and confusing, however, basic 
operation is simple, as the default parameters of 
the all important `black box' will take care of 
most situations.  You may of course explore the 
possibilities of entering your own parameters as 
you become familiar with its operation.

It is proposed to deal here only with the AX.25 
protocol as this is now the world-wide standard     
and the one supported by this association.  There 
are other protocols but they are outside the scope 
of this booklet.

PACKET RADIO is a means by which error-free 
information can be transmitted and received. It 
requires a computer for its operation, and 
normally the operators communicate by means of 
keyboards and monitor screens. Facilities to store 
and forward messages are usually available, as is 
access to bulletin boards and databases.
The mode of Packet is an ideal marriage for the 
radio amateur who dabbles with computers and is an 
interesting way to obtain ERROR FREE communication 
in either rag chewing, programme or information 
transfer and satellite communication.

If however, you are not computer minded but wish 
to be involved in Packet, there is really no 
problem as the role of the computer can be very 
elementary.

                   <b>ABOUT AAPRA</b>


The Australian Amateur Packet Radio Association 
(AAPRA) was formed in April 1985 with an initial 
membership of ten. Current membership exceeds 400, 
encompassing all Australian states and territories 
and several overseas countries, so we are truly 
multi-national. The Association was formed for 
persons interested in the science and technology 
of Packet radio communications and all associated 
interests.
AAPRA exists to promote and encourage the use of 
Packet radio (AX.25 protocol) by amateur radio 
operators. Services offered by this Association 
include:-
      * informative newsletters
      * supply of software and kits (C=64 &
        Microbee)
      * help with computer terminal software
      * information on the supply of TNCs and
        modems
      * providing a voice in the W.I.A.
      * developing a Packet network throughout      
        Australia
<hr align="CENTER" color="Black">
                    Page 2

The Association (a non profit making group) 
produces a newsletter "DIGIPEAT" quarterly 
informing  members of the latest local and 
overseas developments and achievements including 
technical articles on equipment modifications and 
updates. Current annual membership is $12.00 and 
$18.00 for members outside Australia.

AAPRA has supplied equipment and assisted other 
radio clubs to set up the digipeaters in
Hornsby VK2RPH, Newcastle [Watagan Mts] VK2RPN, 
Mittagong [High Range] VK2RPS, Nowra 
[Mt.Camberwarra] VK2RSD  Coff's Harbour [Bruxner 
Park] VK2RCH, Wollongong [Mt.Murray] VK2RAW, Tumut 
[Mt.Tumorroma] VK2RPT, Orange [Mt.Canobolas] 
VK2RAO, Townsville [Mt.Stuart] VK4RAT, Burnie 
VK7WP, St.George [Mt.Bindo] VK2RDX, Gladstone 
[Caliope Range] VK4RCA, Tamworth [Nowendoc] VK2RPW 
and [Mt.Kaputar] VK2RAB, Ballarat [Mt.Buninyong] 
VK3RPC, Albury-Wodonga [MT.Stanley] VK3RNU, 
Griffith [Mt.Bingar] VK2RGF, Lismore [Mt.Nardi] 
VK2RLO, Manly [Terry Hills] VK2RMB.

Other applications are currently being considered 
to set up digipeaters by providing TNCs, radios 
and technical advice. The resulting network is 
expanding rapidly particularly in the Eastern 
States. The improvement of the network by using 
ROSE for linking and directing communications has 
been our most recent effort, and it is now 
operating well. There is still much to be done to 
develop UHF links in that system. ROSE will be 
described later. The funds for these operations 
have been provided from surplus accumulated from 
sales of packet equipment to members.


The Association stocks products from Pac-Comm. If 
you require a unit for HF and VHF there is the 
PAC-COMM TNC 320 with tuning indicator; there is 
also the TINY-2 TNC which is suitable for VHF 
only. Both these units will suit any computer with 
an RS232 port or TTL connection. New Paccomm 
models such as the TINY-2 PLUS with 96K RAM and 
75K PMS memory, and an upgrade kit for the TINY-2 
to PLUS specifications, can be supplied. We look 
forward to the time when locally produced TNCs 
become readily available.

AAPRA supplies software to emulate TNCs using  
Commodore "C=PAK", ( for C64, 128 and SX64) and 
Microbee "BEEPAK". The C=PAK programme is written 
by Chris Mills, and our Association has sole 
distribution rights. This package comprises a 
personally programmed disc or cartridge, a bare
printed circuit board, instructions for assembly
of the simple modem, and operating instructions. 
The board is connected directly to the user port 
of the Commodore computer without using a 
Commodore RS232 interface. The programme provides 
all the usual facilities of the TNC (AX25 level 
2), digipeating, beacons, file transfers etc, and 
the modem has dual ports, supporting HF and 
VHF/UHF use, with software control.
<hr align="CENTER" color="Black">
                    Page 3

The software AAPRA supplies for the Microbee 
"BEEPAK", is a programme written by Gerard Hill, 
and enables Microbee PC's also to utilise Packet 
radio.  In the case of disc based Microbee fitted 
with the SCC option (the 8530 chip) a simple modem 
similar to the Commodore modem is all that is 
required.  Some models require a simple 
modification to the core-board. For older 
ROM-based models an EPROM containing the software 
can be fitted on-board but a more elaborate modem 
using the 8530 is required externally.  This 
version is not provided by AAPRA as it is not 
economic compared with a commercial  TNC using the 
RS232 port and TELCOM.

Parts to complete the boards of both C=PAK and 
BEEPAK  are readily available.  If you prefer 
AAPRA is able to supply  full modem kits which 
include components, edge connector, box, sockets,   
LEDs etc. Mike plugs are not provided.  Assembled 
and tested modems (for AAPRA members only) require 
only plugs.  A summary is included at the end of 
this booklet.

Members of AAPRA are notified of up-dates for 
equipment in "DIGIPEAT" our quarterly newsletter 
and technical enquiries should be directed to 
Barry White VK2AAB (02)-487-1428 or to the 
secretary.




                 <b>WHAT IS PACKET?</b>


Packet is a development of the original modes of 
radio communication such as Morse and Teletype.  
These modes are essentially digital patterns of 
ON-OFF signals and are used to represent items of 
information such as letters of the alphabet, 
numbers, punctuation etc.  The signals are 
transmitted between stations by methods such as 
radio or cables, and are written down or printed 
out.

Morse is a relatively slow but simple mode.  The 
brain and ears form a sensing device that is 
superior to other means of receiving Morse code 
patterns, as they are much better at pattern 
recognition in the presence of extraneous signals 
and noise.

In order better to automate communication, 
teletype was developed.  It involved more complex 
patterns generated by mechanical "computers".

This gave improved speed and good recognition of 
patterns.  But it is susceptible to production of 
false patterns when extraneous signals and noise 
are received.  Because of the speed involved, 
brain and ears no longer help, although there is 
still use for the brain in guessing what corrupted 
messages were meant to say.  The same problems 
occur even after electronic devices have 
supplanted the mechanical ones.
<hr align="CENTER" color="Black">
                    Page 4

RTTY  (Radio TeleTYpe) characters are made up of 
groups of five ON-OFF signals - the standard code 
now used was devised by a New Zealand sheep farmer 
named Murray, though generally it is misnamed 
Baudot code which is a less efficient earlier 
code.

With the same sort of electronic equipment, ASCII 
code which provides up to 255 characters using a 
seven or eight unit code, can be employed.  It is 
subject to the same kind of interference problems 
as Baudot when used in radio communications, so it 
is rarely used unadorned. Within a computer there 
is no interference, so as you probably know, all 
computers talk ASCII of some sort.

To improve message transfer, error correction was 
incorporated, and AMTOR (Amateur Microprocessor 
Teleprinting Over Radio) is one such development.  
It uses code in groups of three characters, so 
that the value of each group must total a fixed 
sum.  If it does not, when the receiver adds it 
up, it is rejected and retransmission is 
requested.  When it is correct it accepts it and 
asks for the next group.  Using this mode, almost 
error free messages can be exchanged.  When 
propagation conditions are bad, the rate of 
information transfer will slow down but it will 
still be error free.  However, the number of 
character types is limited by the five unit code, 
and there has to be a reactive link between both 
ends of the communication path.

Here is where PACKET comes in.

Packet uses ASCII code, so can have 255 symbols.    
Messages are sent in groups of up to 255 units as 
compared with the three of AMTOR.  Complex error 
checking is installed, as is information to guide 
the Packets through the system.  The system is 
comprised of Terminal Node Controllers (TNC) 
connected to transceivers, each linked with its 
own computer that gives commands to the TNC and
writes and displays the messages.  The packets are 
dispatched entirely automatically. They provide an 
error-free means of communication that permits 
multiple use of a single frequency. Anything that 
can be put into digital form can be sent over 
Packet radio; for example, digital sound or 
television.

At the present time it is very easily used to 
transmit written messages, computer programmes and 
files that are written in ASCII or even binary 
code, between radio amateurs. And the result is a 
screen full of characters in front of your eyes.

Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) form a useful part of 
the system, providing the source of lots of 
information and can act as "mailboxes".  They also 
help in the spread of information by communicating 
with each other, exchanging files and messages.  
Most Packet is best used on VHF, and using the 
property of digipeating, VHF links over long 
distances form a useful communication network. HF 
radio is less efficient with Packet due to 
propagation difficulties often giving rise to many 
<hr align="CENTER" color="Black">
                    Page 5

errors, hence retries, so that information  
transfer is much slower.  Packet lengths need to 
be reduced.  In these conditions AMTOR may be 
better, but the restricted number of characters 
used by AMTOR creates difficulties in linking 
Packet and AMTOR systems. A system to join the 
two, called APLINK, is now being used to connect 
Packet systems more effectively across long 
distances.

This very brief description leaves a lot unsaid, 
but it should lift some of the veil of mystery 
surrounding Packet.  It is just the thing for 
people who are interested in both radio and 
computers, but it also is a fine means of 
communication for people who can remember about 
three simple keyboard commands.



                <b>WHAT YOU WILL NEED</b>



Although Packet radio involves high technology and 
the latest state of the art components, the basic 
equipment required is relatively simple to 
assemble as many amateurs have found.  You can of 
course obtain pre-assembled units at a most 
reasonable price.

The essential requirements are:-

A.  1. A Personal Computer and a Terminal
       programme  OR
    2. A Personal Computer with TNC-emulating       
       software, such as C=PAK and BEEPAK

B.  1. A TNC (black box) such as TINY-2.  OR
    2. A modem for the C=PAK or BEEPAK.

C.  A transceiver preferably with a fixed high      
    impedance audio output, and squelch.




<b>A. COMPUTER</b>

There are of course many breeds and varieties of 
computer.  Essentially the requirement is that the 
computer can run a communications programme. There 
are many such programmes, such as YAPP, available 
in public domain depending on your machine.  The 
vital requirements are that its parameters can be 
set to:-

    baud rate   1200
    parity      even       or Nil
    data bits   7             8
    stop bits   1             1

It is via this programme that data is sent between 
you and the TNC. The commands issued to the TNC 
are also via the same programme.
<hr align="CENTER" color="Black">
                    Page 6

<b>B. TNC and MODEM</b>

1.  Hardware Type
These two units are sometimes combined into a neat 
black box which contains its own microprocessor, 
usually a Z80. It will also include memory chips 
for holding its programme and the data you will be 
transmitting and receiving.  Another chip, the 
HDLC integrated circuit, does all the checking and 
handling of the data as it enters and leaves the 
TNC.

2.  Software Type
If by chance you are a Commodore or Microbee user 
there are programmes available from AAPRA which do 
the job of the TNC; this together with a simple 
modem (also available from AAPRA) is all you will 
require to enjoy the full benefits of Packet.
There are other programmes, such as DIGICOM for 
Commodores, Grosvenor for the Spectrum and Tandy 
COCO. There are also many other modems available 
to buy or build. We are not in a position to give 
specific advice on these.

<b>C. TRANSCEIVER</b>
The bulk of operation at this time is on VHF-FM.  
The original channel set aside for the mode was 
147.575 MHz but usage is now spreading to other 
frequencies namely 147.600, 144.800, 144.850, 
144.900, & 145.050. This will depend on the area 
in which you operate.

HF operation is increasing; this can be helpful to 
those living away from repeater-serviced areas.  
The BBS service also makes good use of frequencies 
within these bands. 10.147 and 14.107MHz are areas 
being used.

UHF usage is still in its infancy. It is envisaged 
that these frequencies will be used to provide 
links between main centres for through traffic
flow, rather than have mail forwarding clutter the 
local VHF frequencies. This is most desirable in 
the higher density areas.

Ideally a transceiver for Packet should have such 
a response as to keep the levels of the Packet  
tones equal. Pac-Comm make a radio tailored to the 
needs of digital radio only.

The connection of your radio to the TNC is a 
simple affair utilizing the microphone socket for 
audio input and Push-to-Talk. Audio line output or 
an external speaker socket which most radios have 
these days provide audio to the TNC/Modem. Full 
instructions will be supplied with the device you 
choose.



               <b>WHY CALL IT PACKET?</b>


Each Packet is a "sandwich" consisting of, in 
order of transmission, header information, 
followed by the data you typed, (if any - some 
packets contain no user data), followed by a very 
<hr align="CENTER" color="Black">
                    Page 7

important 16 bit number called Frame Check 
Sequence (FCS). It is this packaging of the data 
that sets Packet radio apart from all previous 
types of Amateur communication, and which gives it 
special properties.


       <b>OPERATION OF A PACKET RADIO STATION</b>


Packet Radio QSOs are started by a CONNECT 
process, which sets up the "handshaking" between 
the two stations that ensures error-free 
communications. QSOs are terminated by a 
DISCONNECT process, which leaves both stations 
free to start a new QSO. Packet QSOs can also make 
use of digipeaters, other Packet stations which 
can automatically relay packets from one station 
to the other over a specified route.

A local station to station connection is achieved 
by VK2AAA issuing the following command whilst in 
COMMAND mode. (When first switched on most TNCs go 
into the COMMAND mode, so what you type will be 
treated as a command.)
:-
"C VK2BBB"  (C is short for CONNECT)

    VK2AAA ____________>>>_____________ VK2BBB

VK2BBB will respond and VK2AAA's screen will show:

***CONNECTED TO VK2BBB     (for the TNC or BEEPAK)

**SETTING LINK** VK2BBB [DATE] [TIME] (for C=PAK)
*CONNECTED TO* VK2BBB [DATE] [TIME]

Then the QSO follows.... VK2AAA has the 1st over.

To end the connection one station simply issues a 
"DISCONNECT" instruction.  This is achieved by 
sending a "D" whilst in COMMAND mode.  The screen 
will then display:

*** DISCONNECTED      (for the TNC or BEEPAK)

*DISC* VK2BBB [DATE] [TIME]     (for C=PAK)




                   <b>DIGIPEATING</b>


You may wish to have a QSO with another station 
that is beyond your direct radio range. If a third 
Packet station is in range of both you and the 
station you want to talk to, that station can 
relay your packets. You set up the Packet routing 
when you initiate a connection. Your programme 
will then automatically include the routing 
information in the Packet it sends.

The diagram below shows an example situation in 
which digipeating is useful.
<hr align="CENTER" color="Black">
                    Page 8

  VK2AAA _____>>____ VK2RRR  _____>>____ VK2BBB
VK2AAA cannot reach VK2BBB directly, but both can 
reach VK2RRR.
This connection is achieved by VK2AAA issuing the 
following command whilst in COMMAND mode:-

"C VK2BBB V VK2RRR"       (for the TNC or BEEPAK)

"C VK2BBB VK2RRR"         (for C=PAK)

VK2BBB will respond and VK2AAA's screen will show

***CONNECTED TO VK2BBB VIA VK2RRR    (for the TNC   
                                      or BEEPAK)

**SETTING LINK** VK2BBB [DATE] [TIME] (for C=PAK)
*CONNECTED TO* VK2BBB [DATE] [TIME]


You can specify a routing list of up to eight 
intermediate stations. For example, consider a 
modification of the example above :-

  VK2AAA _____ VK2CCC _____ VK2DDD _____ VK2BBB

You specify the digipeaters in the order you would 
encounter them going from your station to the 
station to which you wish to connect. 
Unfortunately, long strings are often 
impracticable due to the increased probability of 
retries being needed. A retry occurs whenever an 
error is detected by the receiving station. It 
rejects the packet with the error and asks for a 
retransmission from the originating station.

Your station can also act as a digipeater for 
other stations. This does not require any special
actions on your part, your TNC will do everything 
automatically. If your station is digipeating you 
may occasionally notice your transmitter keying 
during lulls in your own transmissions. Of course, 
a station has to be turned on in order to 
digipeat, and all need to be on the same 
frequency!

Digipeating does not have to be specified if you 
are using a ROSE network (see later). There is 
also a "conference network" that requires a 
specially programmed digipeater, by which it is 
possible for several stations to conduct a 
round-table net.

<b>UNSUCCESSFUL CONNECTIONS.</b>
Sometimes you will initiate a connect sequence 
that cannot be completed. The station may not be 
on the air, or it may not be in range of your 
station. You may have even mistyped the other 
callsign. If the programme does not get a connect 
response to its first connect Packet within a 
specific time, it will try again. You can control 
the number of attempts (or retries). If the 
computer does not receive an answer after the set 
number of attempts it will stop trying. The retry 
count is also activated during a QSO. Each Packet 
you send to the other station is "acknowledged", 
or ACKed by the other station, and vice versa. The 
ACK means that the Packet was received without 
<hr align="CENTER" color="Black">
                    Page 9

errors, the FCS (Frame Check Sequence) was 
correct.

This is the means by which Packet radio can ensure 
error-free communications. Sometimes a Packet will 
not be received correctly by the other station, 
either because of accidental interference from 
another Packet station (a collision), or because 
of other channel noise. If your programme does not 
get an ACK soon enough, it retransmits the Packet 
and starts the retry count, activating it each 
time an un-ACKed Packet was transmitted until it 
reaches the preset retry count. The connect 
attempt or QSO is then automatically disconnected. 
This feature prevents tying up the channel under 
hopeless conditions.

<b>YOUR FIRST PACKET QSO.</b>

Although there are still many features you should 
be familiar with for comfortable Packet operation, 
you are probably eager to get on the air and try 
out your programme. Arrange to have another Packet 
operator on air to help you. Make sure that your 
friend will be close enough to ensure solid copy, 
with no FM "popcorn" noise.


                    <b>PROCEDURE.</b>

<b>CONNECTING STATION BEGINS THE QSO.</b>

The calling station (The one using the 
"CONNECT"command), is the station which sends the 
first Packet. All kinds of confusion will result 
if the called station AND the calling station both 
begin the QSO. Even though there is no possibility 
of "doubling" with Packet (unlike phone), the 
resulting confusion of not knowing who's turn it 
is, does take some sorting out.
HOWEVER, when connected to a BBS, wait till it 
prompts you to give it a command.

<b>EACH TRANSMISSION ENDS WITH "KK"</b>

The normal Packet QSO is similar to that 
experienced on RTTY with the letters KK added to 
the end of each "over". This is to let the 
receiving station know that you have ended your 
transmission and now it is the other station's 
turn to transmit. Transmission of the packets is 
extremely fast and since many of us are poor 
typists, there can sometimes be considerable 
delays between packets. Delays can lead the 
newcomer to think that it is now their turn and 
chaos often results. International QSOs sometimes 
use ">>" symbol instead of "KK".

<b>COMMENCE EACH TRANSMISSION WITH A CARRIAGE RETURN.</b>

When you begin each over, commence with a carriage 
return (C/R). This is to let the other station 
know that "you are still alive" and have commenced 
typing your reply. Otherwise, if you are really 
slow on the keyboard, it could take up to a minute 
or so to type your reply and the other station may 
think you have gone off the air.
<hr align="CENTER" color="Black">
                    Page 10

<b>CONCLUDE QSO WITH "SK SK"</b>

At the conclusion of the last over, end the 
transmission with SK SK. This gives the other 
station the opportunity to "tie the ribbons" etc..


<b>EITHER STATION MAY DISCONNECT.</b>

When the QSO has ended and both parties have sent 
their last packets (ended with SK SK), either 
party may issue a disconnect Packet.
When you are connected to another station you are 
in CONVERSE mode. In order to give the DISCONNECT 
command you have to change to COMMAND mode. (See 
below). Then you can press D, which is the command 
to disconnect.
The C=PAK programme gives information in two 
status lines at the top of the screen, from which 
you can tell if all packets have been sent. Dont 
disconnect if a packet is still waiting to be sent 
and ACKed, or the other station will not have 
received all that you typed in.

TNCs have a status LED to give that indication.

<b>BEACONS.</b>

The TNC is able to send beacons at preset 
intervals. This mode can be used to send
announcements or test messages whilst unconnected. 
Use this function with caution as too many 
beacons, or beacons too frequently, add 
unnecessary congestion to a busy frequency.

<b>STATUS.</b>

Your programme may be in COMMAND, UNCONNECTED, 
CONNECTED or FILE TRANSFER mode.

<b>COMMAND MODE.</b>

This mode is selected with <CTRL><C>, or RUN/STOP 
on the Commodore, and enables the issue of 
commands within the programme. These commands are 
not transmitted. Digicom requires a colon at the 
first place on the line, to enable the command 
mode.

<b>CONNECTED or UNCONNECTED (UNPROTO) MODE.</b>

Text typed on the keyboard is transmitted 
regardless of whether you are in connected or 
unconnected mode. The information you type is 
assembled by the programme into packets and 
transmitted over the radio. The send Packet 
character (a carriage return [C/R]) causes the 
input to be packetised for transmission. If you 
type a full Packet length of characters without 
typing the send Packet character [C/R], your input 
will be packetised and transmitted anyway.
An UNPROTO transmission is one that is not 
addressed to another station in particular, 
enabling one to call CQ, for example.

The number of characters in a Packet is usually 
128 but can be as many as 256. Sometimes when 
<hr align="CENTER" color="Black">
                    Page 11

operating on HF the number of characters in a 
Packet can be reduced to just a few, e.g. 5 or 10.

<b>FILE TRANSFER MODE.</b>

Packet radio is very well suited to the transfer 
of data between computers. In some cases whilst 
transferring programme files there will be 
conflict between the special characters contained 
in the file and the main programme; this will 
cause some unusual screen graphics to appear and 
sometimes after transfer is complete it is 
difficult to work out where the cursor should be. 
To overcome this  simply go to COMMAND mode with:
    1. TNC - send three <CTRL> C's within the time  
       set by the command CMDTIME.  In layman's     
       terms, quickly. There will be a short delay  
       and the "cmd:" prompt will appear. To clear  
       the screen, use the command as set by the    
       terminal programme (commonly ALT C ). You    
       should study the manual carefully before
       attempting this option as other parameters   
       may need to be altered.
    2. C=PAK  -  (RUN/STOP), press SHIFT and        
       CLR/HOME followed by a Carriage Return.
This will clear the screen and allow you to         
continue.   There are programmes such as YAPP that 
have been designed to transfer binary files 
without such conflicts, but they are 
computer-specific.



                <b>THE ROSE NETWORK.</b>

ROSE software and the associated node controllers 
and radios are being installed progressively at 
appropriate locations. ROSE identifies each 
location by an address derived from area and 
exchange codes of the existing telephone system. 
The user does not need to know how to get to an 
address; all that procedure is set up within the 
network.

The Rose network software improves the reliability 
of the transfer of packets from the originator to 
the destination station through the chain of
repeaters. It does this by sending the 
acknowledgement ACK between each link in the chain 
rather than from the remote end back to the 
origin.

As you have seen previously the protocol used in 
amateur packet radio is AX25 which is derived from 
a commercial landline protocol defined by the 
CCITT called X25. In Rose we use X25 between the 
repeaters only. In X25 each repeater, known in X25 
as a switch, has an address which complies with a 
CCITT standard known as X121. This address 
comprises 6 figures. It has been decided that the 
telephone STD and exchange codes will be used for 
this purpose.


As an example, the Hornsby and District Amateur 
Radio Club's repeater VK2RPH has an address of 
247600. The 2 is the STD code for Sydney and 476 
<hr align="CENTER" color="Black">
                    Page 12

is the exchange code for the area in which the 
repeater is installed. This repeater acts not only 
as a normal digipeater (VK2RPH-1) but also accepts 
a connection to its node controller, through which 
the software directs the packets via links 
(generally on VHF/UHF but eventually there will be 
HF links too) to their destinations. The following 
is a list of the present Rose repeater numbers:


VK2RPH        247600    Hornsby
VK2RMB        245000    Terrey Hills
VK2RDX        633600    Mt Bindo
VK2RPS        487100    Mittagong
VK2RAW        488500    Wollongong
VK2RPT        694700    Tumut
VK2RSD        442100    Nowra
VK2RAO        636500    Orange
VK2RGF        696200    Griffith
VK2RPN        49....    Newcastle
and so on......
           Wollongong, Nowra and Newcastle are 
still to be converted. There are ROSE nodes north 
of Sydney which will be linked as further nodes 
are installed in the gaps. UHF links already exist 
from Sydney to Orange, and within the Sydney area.
All these nodes act as ordinary digipeaters using 
the sub-station identifier (SSID)"-1" eg VK2RPH-1

At the time of writing quite a few Rose nodes are 
operating. Assume that VK2RPH is local for you.
You want to call VK2AAA in the Orange area.
You do not need to know about the Orange 
repeater's code. All you need to know is the 
telephone number of VK2AAA, or that of his local 
post office. Let us assume that his phone number 
is (068) 82 4101. Enter the following:

C VK2AAA V VK2RPH,688200 (With C=PAK omit "V" and 
",". Use spaces instead.)
The system will reply "Call being Set Up" and then 
"Connected to VK2AAA". This does not mean the 
connection is made, but is to stop your TNC trying 
again to connect while the call is being set up. 
On true connection, it will say "Call completed.."  

The Orange repeater is set up to accept all calls 
for telephone STD exchange codes in its RF 
coverage so it will recognise the above number as 
being in its coverage area. The node at VK2RPH 
will have been told the route to take to reach the 
688200 area repeater. Without ROSE, you would have 
to know which repeaters to use on the way to 
Orange.
For more information on the operation of this 
software you should look in the files of the BBSs.  
AAPRA members will be kept up to date in the 
Associations newsletter DIGIPEAT which is produced 
on a quarterly basis.

               <b>BULLETIN BOARDS.</b>

The Bulletin Board Service (BBS) has developed 
into a worldwide network, providing access to 
information by way of message forwarding. Messages 
may be lodged with your local BBS for transmission 
for all to read or if you wish by private message.  
<hr align="CENTER" color="Black">
                    Page 13

There are many options available , for example 
messages may be `addressed' to a particular Packet 
operator at another BBS where he is located, no 
matter where in the world.

The use of a BBS is very easy - you simply 
`connect' in the normal fashion, BUT wait for the 
BBS to prompt you before typing anything. On your 
first connection you will receive a welcome 
message and be asked to supply your first name.  
ALWAYS wait for a prompt from the BBS before 
sending anything; the prompt will be in the form 
of a menu.  Should response be slow there is a 
temptation to hit the carriage return key. This 
does not help and in some early versions of the 
software caused a problem. Sending indiscriminate 
carriage returns merely sends out additional 
Packets and helps to slow down the system.

On your first connection with a BBS you should ask 
for the `help' file. Open up a file on your
computer to save the incoming packets (or if using 
a C-64 the information will go into the receive 
buffer and may be saved to disc after logging 
off). Send an "h", then log off on completion by 
sending a "b" (for goodBye) and study the 
information you have just received.  You will be 
surprised how easy it is to use the system and 
just how versatile it can be. The BBS systems can 
differ... read the help files carefully.

As a matter of courtesy, if operating a BBS in 
peak times when there is a lot of traffic, you 
should avoid downloading large files as this will 
clutter the frequency and possibly inconvenience 
other users who may be enjoying a quiet QSO.  
Remember to download large files at a quiet time.

For the benefit of those users of MS-DOS/PC-DOS 
and Commodore computers, there is also public 
domain software available from some BBS's.  Such 
files are binary files and the technique of 
downloading is a little different, so you should 
seek additional information prior to attempting 
this procedure depending on the system you are 
running.

If you intend to leave a lengthy message on the 
BBS it is a good idea first to produce the message 
on your word-processor. It must be an ASCII file, 
that is an "unformatted" or "non-document" type. 
Once you are connected to the BBS it is easy to 
send the prepared file rather than try to type 
whilst connected, as the BBS usually will only 
wait a short time before disconnecting you while 
you are typing out the message.  Apart from that 
you may be tying up the system unnecessarily 
whilst others are waiting.

               <b>FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS</b>

Packet radio is a rapidly evolving mode and many 
changes can yet be expected.  Protocols are still 
under review and such areas as high speed modems 
and satellite communications are prime targets for 
development.

The use of digipeaters has been effective in 
enabling amateurs spread over large areas to 
partake in the packet activity that has been a 
feature of the last few years. However digipeaters 
have a major disadvantage in that if a packet is 
misread by the addressed station or a repeater 
along the way, the packet has to be sent again all 
the way from the originating station.

To overcome this problem network software has been 
developed that repeats the packet only between the 
repeaters concerned with the lost packet. The 
systems used for this procedure are known as the 
Open Systems Information Protocols. These  OSI 
standards approved by the CCITT comprise seven 
levels of control. With the introduction of 
network software we will be implementing level 3.

The software that we are at present installing is
known as ROSE. With this system we are able to 
connect to our local repeater and specify the 
station that we wish to connect with and the 
repeater that is near that station. Our local 
repeater will know which other repeaters it must 
use to reach the remote repeater.

While the users will connect to the network on the 
two metre band the connections between the 
repeaters will be on the 70cm band or another band 
such as HF, and will enable packets to pass 
through busy areas of activity without having any 
effect on the local traffic.

Ways and means are being sought to increase the 
speed at which information can be sent. Some 
equipment just is incapable of coping with this, 
which will probably lead to stratification of 
amateur packet operators as in other fields where 
the super-dooper exists alongside the Heath 
Robinson. Some people will devote themselves to 
Satellite Communications where packet has come to 
the fore, with as many types of modem as there are 
satellites!


Packet is an exciting addition to the hobby of 
Amateur Radio utilising modern technology.


Good luck and good Packetting!

               most of the work that is done by     
               the normal TNC programme is done in  
               the computer only a very small part  
               of the normal programme is needed    
               in the TNC to handle the transfer    
               across the RS232 and taking data     
               from the SIO chip, also detecting    
               DCD.
