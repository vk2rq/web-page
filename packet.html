<H2>AX.25 Packet on Linux</H2>
<P>Recently I have been experimenting with setting up packet radio on an
ASUS netbook running Debian Linux. There have been a few challenges with this,
which I describe below.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Installation of AX25 Lib/Tools/Apps: the problem here is that the packages
supplied with debian are a little old, and assume that the kernel has support
for legacy BSD-style pseudo-terminals. However, in the standard kernel
distributed with debian linux, support for the legacy ptys has not been
compiled in. So, I had a choice of recompiling the kernel to support the
legacy ptys, or else compile up newer versions of the ax25libs/tools/apps
that support the new Unix98-style ptys. I chose the latter.</LI>
<LI>The AX.25 "call" program supplied in the ax25apps package was crashing
when I resized the window, and didn't have support for any scrollback buffer.
I found a <A HREF="http://marc.info/?l=linux-hams&m=126174094113550">patch</A> on the web that addresses these issues, but it was built against 
ax25-apps-0.0.8-rc2, and wouldn't apply cleanly to the more recent version
of call.c in CVS that supports the Unix98 PTYs. So, I updated the patch
to make it compatible with the newer release, and you can
<A HREF="call.patch">download the updated patch here<A>.
</LI>
<LI>I had an issue with getting
<A HREF="http://www.baycom.org/~tom/ham/soundmodem/">linux soundmodem</A> to work
at 300baud. I found the fix was to use modem tones less than 4*300=1200Hz.
However, I wanted to cover the national APRS freqnency on 40m and the 
frequency used by our local packet group around 1kHz higher together at
the same time with the same radio. I found a
<A HREF="soundmodem_300baud.patch">testing patch</A> against
soundmodem-0.16 that removes this restriction on the modem tones.</LI>
<LI>The aprsd packaged with debian doesn't support multiple TNCs, and you
can only run one instance of it on the system. So, I looked to the APRX
daemon instead. This does support multiple TNCs, but unfortunately
kept dumping core on my system. I made a small 
<A HREF="aprx_telemetry.patch">patch</A> to prevent this from happening.</LI>
<LI>I found a patch to provide Internode Protocol (INP3) Support for Linux on
<A HREF="http://sharon.pi8zaa.ampr.org/users/pe1rxq/inp3.html">this page.</A> 
However, the patch was written against linux kernel 2.6.4, and does not apply cleanly to the latest 2.6.32 kernel.
So, I <A HREF="2.6.32-inp3_007.patch">updated the patch<a>. However, I found that the patch causes a soft lockup
when taking an AX25 interface out of service, due to a deadlock with the spin_locks, so some additional work is
needed to address this. Investigations so far indicate a problem with nr_del_node_found(), which removes neighbours
and nodes that are no longer valid. When it is called, sometimes there is already a lock on the global neighbour
list, and sometimes there is also a lock on the global node list. When removing a neighbours or node, an attempt
will be made to acquire a lock on the global neighbour or node list, and if such a lock is already existing, there 
is a deadlock, and the CPU will just spin. Will need to think about the best way to clean up the code.</LI>

VK2IO BBS/VK2IO-1 node is separate instance from VK2IO on HF; links to wider packet network with message forwarding (via RF only, no internet); I can connect from my QTH via VK2AMW-7 node/digipeater

 Reception is too marginal from my QTH, need a better antenna :-)  Would then be able to access VK2IO, VK2DOT.
